# MIE2024 Masterclass R & Shiny

## Introduction

At the MIE2024 conference, we presented a brief masterclass on R and Shiny. 
The masterclass was aimed at researchers working primarily with survey data. 

As was to be expected, a masterclass of two 45min sessions can hardly cover all
relevant topics in depth.

We therefore decided to make our code examples public in the form of an R Package.

Feel free to contact the package maintainer (david@dataim.nl) for any technical matters.
