# MIE2024 Masterclass R & Shiny

## Introduction

At the MIE2024 conference, we presented a brief masterclass on R and Shiny. The masterclass was aimed at researchers working primarily with survey data.

As we anticipated, two 45min sessions were hardly sufficient to cover all relevant topics in sufficient depth We therefore decided to make our code examples public in the form of an R Package.

Feel free to contact the package maintainer ([david\@dataim.nl](mailto:david@dataim.nl){.email}) for any technical matters or follow-up questions.
